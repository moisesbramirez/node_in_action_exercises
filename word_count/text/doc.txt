Feedparser parses each feed into a meta (emitted on the meta event) portion and
one or more articles (emited on the data event or readable after the readable
is emitted).

Regardless of the format of the feed, the meta and each article contain a
uniform set of generic properties patterned after (although not identical to)
the RSS 2.0 format, as well as all of the properties originally contained in
the feed. So, for example, an Atom feed may have a meta.description property,
but it will also have a meta['atom:subtitle'] property.

The purpose of the generic properties is to provide the user a uniform interface
for accessing a feed's information without needing to know the feed's format
(i.e., RSS versus Atom) or having to worry about handling the differences
between the formats. However, the original information is also there, in case
you need it. In addition, Feedparser supports some popular namespace extensions
(or portions of them), such as portions of the itunes, media, feedburner and
pheedo extensions. So, for example, if a feed article contains either an
itunes:image or media:thumbnail, the url for that image will be contained in
the article's image.url property.
